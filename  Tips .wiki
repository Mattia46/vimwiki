When re-render a component, react assumes that has to re-render it because
the following method is called.
If we don't want re-render the component we need to return false instead of true,
If we don't render a Component, React won't re-render the nested component as
well.
{{{Javascript
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return true;
}
}}}
You can achieve the same result of return false by using React.PureComponent
instead of React.Component when declair the component
